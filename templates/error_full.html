      Sorry. This survey was completed because the limit is reached. Thank you for your interest.

      There might be disparity between the MTurk page and this web page about the number of hits available.
      This is because we count up when people begin their process. Since we have some people who quit before submitting their results, the number on the Mturk page tends to be larger.
      We try our best to minimize the difference. If you see the message that says "the limit is reached" and you are still interested in, please come back later.
